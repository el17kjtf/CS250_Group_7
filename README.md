## Description

Tradâ€™M is a flea market mobile phone application for Android created to aid foreign students studying in Korea. 
Its purpose is to bring buyers and sellers of a wide variety of goods and services together by creating a marketplace where sellers can create offers for the goods and services they wish to sell, and buyers can search this marketplace for goods and services they are looking for.
Once a buyer has found an offer he wishes to buy, he then waits for the seller to finalize the agreement, afterwhich, both parties can meet up to exchange the good/service being sold for the payment. 
Users must create an account to be able to use the application.
